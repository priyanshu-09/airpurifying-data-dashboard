Clone this repository on your local machine

Then head towards /api directory.

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies for this project's backend

### `npm start`

You can use [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) for accessing the APIs on Postman

## For running frontend

From the main directory head to /client directory

### `npm install`

## Things to keep in mind

1. The MongoDb won't run on your local network unless you add your current IP Address to the whitelisted IPs on the Cluster
2. Keep in mind to place the .env file in the /api directory of this project
3. In case the PORT "3000" is occupied on your machine, do change the value of the current running port at /api/index.js:26 
<!-- ### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
